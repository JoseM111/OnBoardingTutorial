         The root view controller provides the content view of
         the window. Assigning a view controller to this property
         (either programmatically or using Interface Builder)
         installs the view controllerâ€™s view as the content view
         of the window. The new content view is configured to
         track the window size, changing as the window size
         changes. If the window has an existing view hierarchy,
         the old views are removed before the new ones are installed.

         class UINavigationController : UIViewController
         ------------------------------------------------------
         A navigation controller is a container view controller
         that manages one or more child view controllers in a
         navigation interface. In this type of interface, only
         one child view controller is visible at a time. Selecting
         an item in the view controller pushes a new view controller
         onscreen using an animation, thereby hiding the previous
         view controller. Tapping the back button in the navigation
         bar at the top of the interface removes the top view
         controller, thereby revealing the view controller underneath.
